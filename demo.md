<!--This page gives a brief demo of using TreeRegex.

TODO: fix up sexps
In the first box, you can either write serialized tree expressions or JavaScript code.  After writing JavaScript code, press the "JavaScript to Serialized Tree" button to convert it to a serialized tree.  After the box has a serialized tree in it, it can be matched against a TreeRegex.  Enter a TreeRegex in the second box and then click the match button.

If an error occurs, it will be displayed below the box which the error is from.  If no error occurs, the matches will be displayed below the TreeRegex box.

TODO: add in logic and boxes
TODO: consider expanding to replacement
TODO: consider adding flags like findall (see JavaScript regex flags)-->
