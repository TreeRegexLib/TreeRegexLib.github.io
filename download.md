To use TreeRegex you need two applications: a frontend to convert source code (or other tree-structured text) into an annotated form and a TreeRegex implementation.

[To download a frontend, see our repo here.](https://github.com/TreeRegexLib/treeregex_frontends), Requires Python or JavaScript, depending on the frontend

To download an implementation, see our repos here:
* [C++ Library + CLI Tools](https://github.com/TreeRegexLib/treeregexlib_cpp), Requires C++11 compatible compiler
* Other versions coming soon!
<!--* ~~Java Library~~ *Coming Soon!*-->
<!--* ~~JS Library~~ *Coming Soon!*-->
